		<h1>Website and Digital consultation</h1>
		<p>I have 15 years experience building and working with websites for both small businesses and large enterprises. I've created outcome focussed experiences for both customers and front-office staff in large enterprises, and I've optimised business processes to drive cost efficiencies and delight customers. I am comfortable working and communicating across all levels of a business, from front-line staff interacting with customers to Senior Management.</p>
		<p>I've worked across the full cycle of the product management life-cycle, from requirements definition and process and journey mapping, to design and implementation, testing, and launch. I've also maintained and improved products and retired products form market.</p> 
		<p>I have extensive experience with a number of Open Source and enterprise Content Management systems, including Drupal 8, Wordpress, Joomla, Fatwire, and Web Centre Sites. I've also built numerous custom CMS templates and have been responsible for set up, confirguration, and ongoing administration of a variety of websites large and small.</p>
		<p>I am comfortable working in both Business and Technical environments, agile or waterfall or a hybrid of the two. I believe in simple and maintainable solutions to complex problems.</p>
